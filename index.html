                        Hereâ€™s a shortened method for cultivating the Frame of Flower:

Use well-drained, slightly acidic soil rich in organic matter. Plant in partial sunlight or light shade, preferably in cooler climates. Sow seeds in early spring or fall, covering them lightly with soil and spacing them 12-18 inches apart. Keep the soil moist but not waterlogged, and add compost or balanced fertilizer during planting for healthy growth. Remove wilted flowers and prune after blooming to encourage further flowering. Propagate by dividing plants every 2-3 years. Occasionally check for aphids and use organic treatments if needed.
